## Component pattern

## Intent
To use architecture evident coding style. To guide the developer to the concept of an defining an interface as an 
component, and to make clear of the isolation of the other classes that implements the component only accesible by the 
component. This example demonstrated a simplified component. A component interface does not need to have 
abstract methods, the component interface could be empty, just for guidance of defining a component for developers.

## Applicability
To guide the developer to follow the architecture by defining the components as an interface (with accesible methods),
 and to prevent them to break the architecture by trying to modify the visibility level of the classes that implements 
 the component.
