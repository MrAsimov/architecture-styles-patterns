# Decorator pattern
    * Structure

## Intent
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing 
for extending functionality.

## Applicability

Use Decorator 

• to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects. 

• for responsibilities that can be withdrawn. 

• when extension by subclassing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and 
would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise 
unavailable for subclassing.
