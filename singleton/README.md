# Singleton pattern
    * Creational

## Intent
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

## Applicability
Use the Singleton pattern when 

• there must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point. 
• when the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance 
without modifying their code.
